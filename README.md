# Algorithm
Machine learning algorithms built from scratch. 
I understand that it's more convenient to work with already created modules for implenting machine learning algorithms.

However, it's really awesome to be able to code these algorithm from scratch, understanding how and why they work. Every Algorithm file in this repository are coded from scratch.

Algorithms:

*Perceptron*
*Linear Regression*
*Logistic Regression*
